This is a wordle robot that can play wordle with code! It is based on entropy, so its validity is proved. Remember that if the letter is correct, type G; if the letter is in the wrong place, type Y; else, type N. You may not directly use this code in wordly.org, because when the correct answer is abcde(example used) and your answer is aecef, then wordly will show GNGNN, but you should type GYGYN because the two "e"s are all in the wrong place. Enjoy using it!(Tips: you can run it directly on your compiler.)
